            <p>Susceptibility to autoimmune disease can be impacted by environmental factors which encompass everything around us including the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, synthetic and natural chemicals, microorganisms, radiation, industrial by-products, and physical factors. Epidemiological analysis has suggested that exposure to mercury can be associated with increased risk of autoimmunity. Mercury exposure can occur in many ways including skin care products such as skin lightening creams, and also during artisanal gold mining. The human populations at risk of exposure are sizable and diverse. Mercury is used by small scale gold miners in 50 developing countries and is a major source of mercury contamination in the associated rural communities. It is believed that between 10-15 million people, including women and children are directly involved in artisanal gold mining.</p>

			<p> Murine mercuryâ€“induced autoimmunity (mHgIA) can be induced by numerous exposure routes and chemical forms including subcutaneous injection or oral ingestion of mercuric chloride (HgCl2), inhalation of mercury vapor, and dental or peritoneal implantation of mercury containing dental amalgam. The severity of disease is dependent upon strain, gender and exposure dose. The features of mHgIA, including lymphadenopathy, hypergammaglogulinemia, humoral autoimmunity, and immune-complex deposits, are consistent with the systemic autoimmunity of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The most characteristic aspect of autoimmunity induced by mercury is an MHC-restricted autoantibody response against fibrillarin, a nucleolar protein component of the box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complexes. Anti-fibrillarin antibodies are found in systemic autoimmune diseases SLE and scleroderma.</p>
